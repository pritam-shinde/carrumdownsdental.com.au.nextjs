                    <Typography><strong>Intraoral camera</strong></Typography>
                    <Typography className='para'>An intraoral camera takes photos of your teeth to make you become part and parcel of your prognosis. The photos can then be displayed on a monitor where you can see and your dentist can discuss with you any areas of major concern and even suggest a variety of possible treatments depending on each individual dental problem. This allows for dental problems such as cavities and malocclusion to be carefully diagnosed and treated.</Typography>
                    <Typography className='para'>Additionally, the camera allows magnification of your tooth for a more precise and detailed prognosis. Magnification aids the dentist is checking for any hidden cracks or cavities that are just starting. The pictures can then be used for comparisons before, during, and after treatment to monitor a patient’s progress by looking at each progressive picture. This helps to determine if a treatment is working as desired or not.</Typography>

                    <Typography className='para'>Unlike traditional x-rays, digital x-rays emit less radiation and are therefore safer. Digital x-rays also allow for electronic storage and transfer which helps in cases of patient referrals. Depending ona patient to patient needs, digital x-rays can be used to track the progress of treatments by making comparisons to previous x-rays. The x-rays can also be emailed and stored for any future references.</Typography>

                    <Typography className='para'>Nitrous oxide is known for its sedative properties to reduce anxiety during treatment, making the treatment process more comfortable not only for the patient but also for the dentist.Once a patient inhales the gas, it enters the bloodstream and its pain-relieving and sedative properties are activated as it reaches the brain and flows through the body. It helps the patient relax, eliminating any discomfort and anxiety which are not ideal conditions for a patient to be in during the dental procedure.</Typography>
