By addressing dental issues promptly, you can avoid potential complications that may arise from postponing treatment. Additionally, investing in your oral health now can save you both time and money in the long run, as preventive measures are often more cost-effective than extensive procedures later on.

                                    If you find dentist visits to be stressful and you delay your appointments because of dental anxiety, the sleep dentistry is the solution. This procedure allows you to enter into a sleep induced by general anesthesia during the dental treatment.

                                    When you are at a dentist, sleep could be the easiest way to calm your nerves and complete the procedure.
                                    It helps you overcome problems of pain or discomfort that you may otherwise experience during the treatment. When you are under general anesthesia, your body enters into a sleep-like state. In this state of unconsciousness, you don&apos;t feel any pain.

                                    Happy gas, or laughing gas, as it is often called, is actually a combination of happy gas and oxygen delivered through a safe Porter System to achieve a mild form of analgesia and sedation.
                                    A nosepiece is normally used to deliver this sedative. Our Dentists often uses this form of Sleep dentistry for children over 12 years of age and adults who have mild anxiety issues and can tolerate a mask over their nose. As this form of anaesthesia depends on the patientâ€™s ability to breathe comfortably through the nose, any form of the respiratory disorder can make this a difficult option for Sleep dentistry.
