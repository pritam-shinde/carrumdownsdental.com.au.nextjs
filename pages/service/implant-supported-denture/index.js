They ensure that your dentures stay put while you talk and eat, leading to increased confidence in social settings and the ability to enjoy your food with ease. An implant-supported overdenture is an ideal solution for those who have experienced issues with unstable or ill-fitting dentures. It attaches to special dental implants that are surgically implanted in the jawbone, providing a reliable and secure closure for the denture.
