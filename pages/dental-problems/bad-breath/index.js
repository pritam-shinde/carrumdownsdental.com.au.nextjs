Among these, inadequate oral hygiene and dry mouth stand as the most prevalent. Nonetheless, alternative potential triggers include the consumption of strong-smelling foods such as garlic and onions, which can leave an undesirable lingering odour in the mouth.
                                                    Furthermore, the consumption of alcohol, smoking tobacco, and chewing tobacco are additional culprits behind bad breath. In exceptional instances, a connection may exist between bad breath and illnesses originating in other parts of the body.

One technique involves enclosing your hands around your mouth and nose and then taking a deep breath. If the resulting odour is unpleasant, then it is likely that you have bad breath. Licking your wrist and detecting any unpleasant scent upon smelling it could suggest the same issue.
                                                    For a more precise evaluation, consulting with Carrum Downs Dental Group professionals is recommended. Our dentists have specialised tools that can gauge the odour of your breath, facilitating an accurate diagnosis and appropriate guidance.

                                                    Absolutely, effective management of bad breath can be achieved in the comfort of your own home. Adopt proper oral hygiene practices, which include brushing your teeth with fluoride-infused toothpaste and regular flossing. Establishing a routine of brushing your teeth twice daily and flossing once daily is pivotal to diminishing bad breath and upholding oral health. Doing so effectively eliminates food particles, bacteria, and plaque that can lead to undesirable odours.
                                                    Furthermore, incorporating the use of a tongue scraper or brushing your tongue aids in reducing the accumulation of bacteria on its surface, a contributing factor to halitosis. Alongside brushing and flossing, integrating a mouthwash into your regimen can be beneficial, as it combats the bacteria responsible for bad breath. Staying well-hydrated by drinking ample water also plays a role in rinsing away food particles and bacteria, contributing to the maintenance of a pleasantly fresh breath.
